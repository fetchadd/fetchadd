The PDG makes explicit both the data and control dependences for each operation in a program.　

Data dependence graphs have provided some optimizing compilers with an explicit representation of the define-use relationships implicitly present in a source program. 

A control flow graph has been the usual representation for the control flow relationships of a program. the control conditions on which an operation depends can be derived from such a graph.

An undesiable property of a control flow graph, howerer, is a fixed sequencing of operations that need not hold.

Our motivation in developing the PDG has been to develop a program representation useful in an optimizing compiler for a vector or parallel machine. Such a compiler must perform both convential optimizations as well as new transformations for the detection of parallelism.

First, we consider the set CD of control dependence predecessors of each nonregion node that has other than a single unlabled control dependence predecssor.
